## Welcome to the Simple Shell !

This is a project made in 2022. Its purpose was to teach us about Linux and its system calls, while also learning the intricacies of C.

The Simple Shell handles a number of simple to rather complex tasks, that a high level Shell will provide. 

Requirements:
- a Linux environment.

Try: 
- 'cd'
- 'getpath'
- 'setpath PATH'
- 'history'
- 'alias ALIAS COMMAND'
- 'unalias ALIAS'
